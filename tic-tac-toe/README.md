# Three in a Row: Dobot Magician Game Player

Code for a Dobot Magician robot to play the game "tic-tac-toe" against a human opponent.


## Materials:
To play the game, you will need the following materials:

- Dobot Magician robotic arm
- WebCam for visual recognition
- Three in a Row game board
- Six tokens (three of one color and three of another)

## Areas for Improvement:
Enhance the AI algorithm used by the Dobot Magician to play the game. The current algorithm is not merely a random solver, but it still needs improvement to become a stronger player.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its enhancement. Enjoy playing "tic-tac-toe" against the Dobot Magician!

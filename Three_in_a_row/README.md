# Three in a Row: Dobot Magician Game Player
This repository contains the code for a Dobot Magician robot to play the game "Three in a Row" against a human opponent.

## Final
This folder contains the final version of the code required to run the game.

## Test
The test folder contains code for conducting tests to aid in the development of the main code. It can be used to create updates for the game in an easier manner.

## Research
This folder contains notebooks with code used for research purposes and experimentation to enhance the game.

## Materials:
To play the game, you will need the following materials:

- Dobot Magician robotic arm
- WebCam for visual recognition
- Three in a Row game board
- Six tokens (three of one color and three of another)

## Areas for Improvement:
Enhance the AI algorithm used by the Dobot Magician to play the game. The current algorithm is not merely a random solver, but it still needs improvement to become a stronger player.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its enhancement. Enjoy playing "Three in a Row" against the Dobot Magician!

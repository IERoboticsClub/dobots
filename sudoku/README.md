![WIP for the GIF](image_file_path)

## Introduction

This project is a Sudoku solver that uses dobot mgician's robotic arms to physically fill in the numbers on a real-life Sudoku board. The robotic arms are controlled by a computer program that uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to read the Sudoku board and determine the correct numbers to fill in.

## Features

- Solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels
- Uses robotic arms to physically fill in the numbers on a real-life Sudoku board
- Computer vision and machine learning algorithms to read the Sudoku board and determine the correct numbers to fill in
- Has a user-friendly graphical interface to input the initial Sudoku board and view the solved board
